                           # Project Proposal- TTP 289

**Aim**: 
* To establish the relationship between the driving patterns and parameters( speed,acceleration,number of stops etc) with the type of drive train, fuel and vocation of the vehicle.

* To predict the type of drivetrain,fuel type and the vocation based on the driving pattern.

**Data set**: FLeet DNA dataset will be employed


**Summary of the data set**:


```{r,echo=FALSE}


# data analysis for FLeet DNA  composite data

library(data.table)
fleetdna_compositedata<-fread("data_for_fleet_dna_composite_data.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

summary(fleetdna_compositedata)
("\n")

```


**Hypothesis to be tested**:

1.	Conventional drivetrains and diesel fuel will be employed for long haul delivery.
2.  local delivery vehicles will be more electriifed as compared to other vocations
3. 

*The drive trains considered are
* The vocations are
* The fuel types are
